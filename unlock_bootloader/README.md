If your phone need an unlock code (like Huawei phone) do this :

You have to obtain 2 informations about your cell : 
 - Model of your phone (optional) : Parameters > About phone
 - The IMEI number : in dial tape :  *#06*
 - The Product ID : in dial tape : *#*#1357946#*#


- To obtain your code, you can send a mail to mobile@huawei.com like : 
"hello, I'd like to request a bootloader unlock code for my huawei device. 
Information : 
 Product : <write the model of your phone>
 Imei : <write the imei number>
 Product ID : <write the number of product ID> Thanks."

You'll receive a mail from huawei. It can be quite long (around 3 days).

--- OPTION 2 (faster to receive code but only for huawei phone) --- 
1) create an account on the huawei plateform : www.huawei.com/en/my-huawei/login
     - email adress, password, first name and last name
You will receive an ID. 
2) go to the china site of huawei : http/zh.ui.vmall.com/emotiondowload.php?mod=unlock&action=apply
3) Enter your login (the id you've received) and your password
4) on the page to unlock enter the information like (imei, product id) 
5) Click to the button to send the request. You immediatly receive your bootloader code under the button ! 

Well done. You have your code to unlock your bootloader !
